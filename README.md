# northern-flights

This is a project I created as an Insight fellow in June 2018. It currently runs at http://northernfights.site.

The Jupyter notebooks used for development are located in the main folder.
The AWS folder contains everything needed to deploy the app on an AWS server. 

I also made a video explaining the use case and the product, which can be found at ***. 

Thanks for your interest!
